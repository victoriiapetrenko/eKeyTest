App task: 

Following is our IOS assignment
1. Create a scene with a Vertical UICollection view with 4 items with a dummy place holder icon. Items should be dynamic (Find the attached image for the reference).
2. On clicking the cell item, it prompts the user with a popup to capture an image, pick an image from the gallery and clear image only if the user already picked the image for the item.
3. Create a separate xib file item cell.
4. Keep comments as a mandatory field.
5. On clicking the Next button, it validates for all data.
6. It will be good if you submit those data with any open-source API but not mandatory.
